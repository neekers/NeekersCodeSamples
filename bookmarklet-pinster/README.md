I was in charge of expanding this code base from simply grabbing images and youtube video embeds out more.  I added the ability to create a screen shot that becomes an image and uploads to amazon s3. Also you can select text or an entire block of content and we will parse out the images and turn the html to markdown and then back to html for sanitization

I was in the process of refactoring out the codebase in relevant classes for further expansion of the code.
