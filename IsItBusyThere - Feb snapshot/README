Want to know the crowd status somewhere BEFORE you drive all the way there and pay $10 to park and still walk 3 blocks?!!
Busy there? is a app that uses the Foursquare API and focuses on the LAST HOUR and only on bars, clubs, restaurants and movie theaters.
Use it look before you go and also use it to check in to let others know. Share the love if you're favorite place is rockin' or the dud you picked from yelp is empty and warn people off. Also great for when in the bar/club scene. Check other similar places within a mile to see if they're busy! No more bar hopping without knowing.
